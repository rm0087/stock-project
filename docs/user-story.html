As of 6/18/2024, the current iteration of this program is the front-end to a tool that will be used to assign keywords 
to stocks so that it can be used in the following manner:

As a user, I want to be able to type in and choose keywords that pull a list of companies that are tagged with my 
specified keyword combination.

Keyword tag database example:
    <Manufacturing>
    <American>
    <Chinese>
    <Tech>
    <Preclinical biotech>
    <Indian>
    <Crypto Mining>
    <Airline>
    <Brazilian>
    <Solar>
    <Name of disease/condition> (for biotech/pharma companies that are working on treatments for specified ailment)
    <Agriculture>

Example scenario: 
    Due to a multitude of reasons, I believe that Brazil may adopt Bitcoin as an official currency in the next few weeks/months. I want to find a company that would
    benefit from such turn of events. I might want to try and find a company in Brazil that mines Bitcoin. Furthermore, in order to maximize my potential future trading
    profits, I would like to find a Bitcoin miner in Brazil that utilizes solar energy in order to offset the high costs of energy that come with mining cryptocurrencies.

    I would first begin by typing a keyword. If the keyword is in the database, an autocomplete tab will pop up with any tags that match what I have typed in so far.
    I can then select the tag, and then begin the process over again until I have all the tags that satisfy my trading idea. For this example it would look something like:
                                                        
                                                            <Brazilian> <Crypto Mining> <Solar>. 
    
From there, I can now see a list of all publically traded companies on NYSE or NASDAQ that fit all of my criteria. Various statistics and measures for the stock will be included
in later versions. The primary goal for this project is to match keywords with stocks.
